## Overview
This app is for those who have a passion for astronomy, but the equipment is too expensive. This app's features are listed below:

1. Maps (Star Maps, Moon Maps, and a lot more!) [WIP]
2. Community (To stay in touch with other astronomers) [WIP]
3. A whole Universe Sandbox! (Just to simulate the universe and see what happens.) [WIP]
4. Tips on astronomy equipment [WIP]
And much more! [WIP]
